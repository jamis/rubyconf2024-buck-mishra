Nothing to see here! Just some code slides for RubyConf 2024.

### Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
> bundle install
```

Build the code snippets:

```bash
> rake
```

Code snippets are generated as PDF's in the `build` folder.

If you need to clean up the build artifacts:

```bash
> rake clean
```

New code snippet source files should be placed in the `src` directory.
